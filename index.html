                    In the summer of 2018 I downloaded the entirety of my gmail
                    account. I couldn't resist reading old emails and chat
                    messages I'd written and received with my girlfriend, who
                    then became my fiance, and then my wife. I thought it would be interesting to apply
                    some data analysis and visualization tools to these messages. This web site
                    is the result of that.

                    The first<a href="#sub1">‚ÇÅ</a> email I sent to her was on
                    3rd December 2008, and sounds right grandmotherly.

                    Baby, be careful driving today. It's snowing hard.
                    Leave for class with plenty of time and drive slow. Please.
                    xoxo

                    Over the next 10 years we would exchange 5,000 emails and chat messages on Gmail products only.
                    From those messages I pulled the 970 most frequently used words between and plotted them here.

                    I was curious to see how often the word "love" appeared. I thought surely it was in the
                    top 5 words we write to one another.
