                    In the summer of 2018 I downloaded the entirety of my gmail
                    account. I couldn't resist reading old emails and chat
                    messages I'd written and received with my girlfriend, who
                    then became my fiance, and then my wife. I thought it would be interesting to apply
                    some data analysis and visualization tools to these messages. This web site
                    is the result of that.

                    The first<a href="#sub1">‚ÇÅ</a> email I sent to her was on
                    3rd December 2008, and sounds right grandmotherly.

                    Baby, be careful driving today. It's snowing hard.
                    Leave for class with plenty of time and drive slow. Please.

                    Over the next 10 years we would exchange <strong>30,068</strong> emails and chat messages on Gmail products only.
                    From those messages I pulled the 970 most frequently used words between and plotted them here.

                    I was curious to see how often the word "love" appeared. I thought surely it was in the

                    Looking at these messages and playing with this data 
                    reminded me of how many little mundane things go into a building a life with
                    someone. The long witty vibrant messages we exchanged early in our relationship so often don't even register
                    in the ocean of one syllable glue words that hold our communication together.
                </p>
                <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure mb4">
                    There is a lot of sweetness and intimacy in those small
                    words. Phrases like these come from them:

                <p class="f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure i pl4 bl bw1 b--light-red mb4">
                    She's getting so big
                </p>
                <p> and </p>
                <p class="f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure i pl4 bl bw1 b--light-red mb4">
                    see you soon!
                </p>
                <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure mb4">
                    It's maybe then almost hot (?!) that we would talk about the <i class="italic">bank</i> more than New
                    Zealand or Mexico.
                </p>
                <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure mb4">
                    Making this showed me that there could be a lot more there, too. I'm resolving to think more about what I write so that the next time I
                    do this we see fewer mentions of <i class="italic">doctor</i> and
                    <i class="italic">hospital</i>, and
                    <i class="italic">bank</i> and <i class="italic">dinner</i>.
                    I intend for there to be more planning words, more happiness words,
                    more <i class="italic">xoxo</i> and more many occurances of
                    the word <i class="italic">love</i>
                </p>
                <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure mb4">
                    I'll start now! 
                    I love you Annie.
                    Merry Christmas xoxo
